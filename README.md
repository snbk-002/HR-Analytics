📌 Attrition by Education
Life Sciences: 38% of total attrition

Medical: 27%

Marketing: 15%

Suggests higher attrition in science-related backgrounds

📌 Attrition by Age Group
26–35 years group shows the highest attrition: 116 cases

Followed by 18–25 and 36–45

Young professionals are most likely to leave — possible career-switching or unmet growth expectations

📌 Attrition by Salary Slab
Upto ₹5K salary accounts for ~69% of attrition (163 out of 237)

Strong indicator that low pay is a key driver of attrition

Research Director: 2

Manager: 5

📌 Job Role vs. Satisfaction
Most employees leaving had satisfaction scores of 2 or 3

Lab Technicians, Sales Executives, and Research Scientists show notable dissatisfaction

Not all attrition comes from lowest satisfaction scores — signals deeper engagement issues

📌 Attrition by Tenure
Highest exits happen in Year 1: 59 employees

A small spike at Year 10 (18 cases) — possibly due to plateaued career growth

Retention efforts should target new hires and long-tenured staff

📌 Attrition by Gender
Male attrition: 150 cases (63%)

Female attrition: 87 cases (37%)

Possible gender disparity worth investigating further
